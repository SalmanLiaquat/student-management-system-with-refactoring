# student-management-system-with-refactoring


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **Extract Class** refactoring technique by moving from a procedural dictionary-based system to an Object-Oriented approach.

### Step 1: Extract Class
- **Problem:** Student data was stored in raw dictionaries, leading to poor encapsulation and high maintenance costs.
- **Solution:** Created `Student` and `StudentManager` classes to separate data from logic.

### Files
* `Before_refactoring.py`: The original legacy code.
* `Extract_class_refactoring.py`: The newly refactored code.
